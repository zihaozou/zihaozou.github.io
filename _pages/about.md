Hello! I'm Zihao, a first year Ph.D student advised by Professor [Praneeth Chakravarthula](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~cpk/) at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Prior to my Ph.D life, I was a graduate researcher at the [Computational Imaging Group (CIG)](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis advised by Professor [Ulugbek Kamilov](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Ulugbek-Kamilov.html).

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of California, Irvine, where I contributed to the [HERO](https://hero.eng.uci.edu/) lab led by Professor [Hung Cao](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/hung-cao). I later completed my Master's in Computer Science at WashU in December 2022.

I do research on Computational Imaging, including imaging inverse problems and 3D/4D reconstructions. I'm actively looking for an Internship for Summer 2025. I'd be thrilled to hear about any opportunities - please feel free to reach out.
