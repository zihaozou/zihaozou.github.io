Hello! I'm Zihao, currently a researcher at the [Computational Imaging Group (CIG)](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis under Professor Professor [Ulugbek Kamilov](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Ulugbek-Kamilov.html).

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of California, Irvine, where I contributed to the [HERO](https://hero.eng.uci.edu/) lab led by Professor [Hung Cao](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/hung-cao). I later completed my Master's in Computer Science at WashU in December 2022.

With a focus on computer vision, computational imaging, optimization, and deep learning, I'm actively looking for a PhD position for Fall 2024. I'd be thrilled to hear about any opportunities - please feel free to reach out.
