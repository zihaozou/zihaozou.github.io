Glad you come to my pageðŸ¤—!

I'm Zihao, a master student in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I am also a member in [Computational Imaging Group (CIG)](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/) advised by Professor [Ulugbek Kamilov](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Ulugbek-Kamilov.html). 

Before I came to Washington University in St. louis, I gained my BS degree in Computer Engineering at University of California, Irvine by 2020. I was a member in the [HERO](https://hero.eng.uci.edu/) lab advised by Professor [Hung Cao](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/hung-cao).

My research interest includes computer vision, computational imaging, optimization and deep learning.

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree after I graduate in Winter,2022. I am also looking for an internship in the Summer, 2023. Feel free to contact me if interested!
